My name is **Roy** and I am a Data Scientist interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://dats.seas.upenn.edu/), with a concentration in Computer Vision. During Summer 2020, I am interning at [The Trade Desk](https://www.thetradedesk.com/) (NASDAQ: TTD) as a Data Science Intern.

I have 2 years of experience working in the computer software and FinTech industry as a Solutions Analyst. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics from [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu/).
