Hi! My name is Roy and I am a Data Scientist interested in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science at the University of Pennsylvania, with a concentration in Computer Vision. During Summer 2020, I am interning at The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) as a Data Science Intern.

I have 2 years of experience working in the computer software and FinTech industry as a Solutions Analyst. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics from New York University.
